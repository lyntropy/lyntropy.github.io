# Art is No Escape

sometimes conspiracy theories like the simulation theory amuse me, in which these theories pose the idea that what if our reality is a simulation.

Personally, I don't really care... Regardless, in my own context, my feelings are real. Everything I have known and will know is real to me.

But this makes me think about the things that aren't real. Like the characters and places I hold dear to my heart. I can imagine these things and how they make me feel.

They aren't real, obviously, but if these things are capable of shaping my identity and my feelings, then wouldn't that make them real to me at the very least?
